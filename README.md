## First semester

This is a repository serving as archive for my work
during first semester of Computer Science. I am a bit 
ashamed by the code I'm making public, but I guess everyone starts somewhere.

### Retrospection

While preparing this archive I had a chance to take a moment (rare for CS
students) and look back at the code I wrote. It's refreshing that after being
put down by all the new asignments, at some moment in time, I **was** worse at
writing code.
