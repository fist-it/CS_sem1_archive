### About
Because of the upfront limitations of the template, I wrote it
exclusively in Visual Studio (never again). 
This project was made from a template which was using local SDL2.10 libraries.


### Explanation

##### Why does it look like that?

I wasn't ambitious enough to write it cross-platform for UNIX systems, so I
wrote it in a Win11 VM. The situation I was put in caused later on problems, so
I'm just sharing source code.

##### How to compile it?
The libraries I used were provided
by the template (SDL2 2.0.10), so if You feel like compiling it you would have
to download them (according to relative path in **support_functions.h**),
You are welcome to do so. My current situation doesn't allow me to test/compile this project.
